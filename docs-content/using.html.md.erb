title: Using Anypoint Platform for PCF
owner: MuleSoft

This topic describes how a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) developer uses Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF to create service instances and bind them to their apps.

##<a id='buildpack'></a> Install the Mule Runtime Buildpack

After installing and configuring the tile, you must also install:

* The Mule Runtime Buildpack
* The Space Configuration Tool

See full instructions about how to install and configure these components [here](https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/configuring-anypoint-platform-for-pcf).

Once you have installed the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF tile, the Mule Runtime Buildpack and the Space Configuration Tool, your developers can create instances of the services within their development spaces. For each PCF space in which they create a service instance, they must create a corresponding Anypoint Space Configuration Tool from the Anypoint interface. See the [Using Anypoint Platform for PCF](using.html) topic for details.


##<a id='space-config'></a> Run the Space Configuration Tool

From Anypoint, run the Space Configuration Tool for each PCF space in which you plan to install a Mulesoft Anypoint service instance.

Each instance of the Space Configuration Tool is linked to one PCF space. Therefore, if you want to use the service in multiple PCF spaces you must also perform multiple installations of the Space Configuration Tool.


##<a id='deploy-apps'></a> Deploy Mule Apps to PCF

For instructions on deploying Mule applications to PCF from the Runtime Manager UI, see the [Deploying to PCF](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/deploying-to-pcf) topic in the Mulesoft documentation.

Note that when deploying a Mule application, you can bind this deployment to a service by setting this in the Anypoint Platform UI.

##<a id='deploy-proxy'></a> Deploy a Mule API Proxy to PCF

For instructions on automatically creating and deploying a Mule proxy application to PCF, see the [Deploy a Proxy to PCF](https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy#to-pivotal-cloud-foundry) topic in the Mulesoft documentation.


##<a id='create-bind'></a> Create and Bind Instances of the Anytime Platform Services

You can create service instance using either the Apps Manager UI or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). Refer to the following topics for instructions:

* **cf CLI**:
	* [Create a service instance](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/managing-services.html#create)

* **Apps Manager**:
	* [Create a service instance](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/marketplace/use-console.html)


Once created, you can bind your Mule application deployments to these services. This can be done either through the Anypoint Platform UI, or alternatively via the Apps Manager UI or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface:

* **Anypoint Platform UI**:
  * [Deploying to PCF](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/deploying-to-pcf#-service-bindings-tab)

* **cf CLI**:
  * [Bind a service instance to an app](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/managing-services.html#bind)
* **Apps Manager**:
  * [Bind a service instance to an app](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/manage-apps.html#manage-service)
